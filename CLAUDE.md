Create a complete, high-converting single-page personal training website using Tailwind CSS and HTML. Follow Swiss design principles — grid layout, clean white space, bold typography, and minimal color palette (black, white, gray, with optional #3B82F6 accent). It must be fully mobile-first and responsive.

Tone: confident, concise, science-informed. Position me as a serious, results-driven coach who blends real training with body science.
